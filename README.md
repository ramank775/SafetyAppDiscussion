# Let's be a human again

This repo for the initiative to bring people to contribute voluntarily, to help the person in need nearby. 


The motive of this initiative is to provide help to the needy as soon as possible, maintaining authenticity so that people can trust the platform.



# Why?

This initiative started by the disheartened, angry, ashamed ones about the recent series of activities such as rape be it the Hyderabad case, Delhi case, increasing the number of eve-teasing cases, the death number of road accidents and the list goes on.



The ultimate goal of this initiative is to create a safe environment for every one of us when we get out of our homes.



# How will it work?



There are two parts of this initiative  
* Create a group a voluntaries 

* Provide a technical platform that helps the group of volunteers to act smoothly



# Why another safety app, aren't there are already many?

This intention of creating a new security app, as any of the existing application doesn't really solve the problem 
Almost of these applications required

* Reliable internet connection, as they continuously track the user

* Too much of user intervention required to raise an alert, which is not always the case

* Even if the alarm is raised, the person who got's the notification is sitting far away and not always the best first person to react



What different we are expecting 

* Offline first application, i.e. application can even work in offline mode.

* Easy to raise an alarm, so best if the application can raise alarm itself if something not usual occurs.

* Alert the nearby volunteer, who most possibly be the best first person to react.

* Raise risk level based alarm.

* Another person sitting far away can also raise the alarm on the behalf of the needy.

* In case of mishaps if happens, an application can provide the identity of the person.

* Verified user's only. Every profile should be verified using govt provided identity like Aadhaar card (which can we verified online easily) to avoid spamming or misuse 

* [Like to have] Raise an SOS/Emergency alarm so the application could even work in state if no network available.



Note: all the above feature is yet to be tested for feasibility
