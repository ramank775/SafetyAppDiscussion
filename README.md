# Let's be a human again

This repo is an initiative to bring people to contribute voluntarily, to help a nearby needy person. 


The motives behind this initiative are to provide help to the needy as soon as possible, to maintain authenticity so that people can trust the platform.



# Why?

This initiative was taken by the disheartened, angry, ashamed one by the recent series of events such as Rape, be it the Hyderabad case or the Delhi case, increasing number of eve-teasing, number of death in road accidents and the list goes on.



The ultimate goal of this initiative is to create a safe environment for every one of us when we are out of our home.



# How will it work?



This initiative include 2 steps:
*To create a group a volunteers

* To provide a technical platform to the group to act smoothly



# Why another safety app, aren't there already many?

The reason behind a new security app is that the existing applications doesn't really solve the problem. 
Almost, all of these applications require

* A reliable internet connection, as they continuously track the user

* Too much of user interventions required to raise an alert, which is not always the case

* Even if the alarm raised, the person who got the notification is sitting far away and not always the best first person to react



What different are we expecting ?

* Offline first application, i.e. application can even work in offline mode.

* Easy to raise an alarm, so best if the application can raise alarm itself if something not usual occurs.

* Alert the nearby volunteer, who most possibly be the best first person to react.

* Raise risk level based alarm.

* Another person sitting far away can also raise the alarm on the behalf of the needy.

* In case of mishaps if happens, an application can provide the identity of the person.

* Verified user's only. Every profile should be verified using govt provided identity like Aadhaar card (which can we verified online easily) to avoid spamming or misuse 

* [Like to have] Raise an SOS/Emergency alarm so the application could even work in state if no network available.



Note: all the above feature is yet to be tested for feasibility
