# Let's be a human again
This Repo for the initiative to bring people to contribute voluntarily, to help the person in need nearby.

The motive of this initiative is to provide help to the needy as soon as possible mantaining the authenticity so that people can trust the plateform.

# Why?
This initiative started by the disheartened, angry, ashamed one's about the recent series of activities such as rape be it the hyderabad case, delhi case, increasing number of eve teasing cases, the death number in raod accident.

Ulimate goal of this initiative is to create a safe enviroment for everyone of us when we set out of our homes

# How will it work?

There are basically two parts of this initiative 
* Create a group a voluntaries 
* Provide a techincal platform that helps the group of volunaties to act soomthly

# Why another safety app, aren't there are already many?
This intention for creating a new security app, as any of existing application doesn't really solves the problem
Almost of these application required
* Reliable internet connection, as they continously tracking the user
* User intervension required to raise a alert, which is not always the case
* Even if alarm is raised, the person who got's the notification is sitting far away and not always the best first person to react

What different we are expecting 
* Offline first application i.e. application can even work in offline mode.
* Easy to raise a alarm, so best if application can raise alarm if something not usual occurs.
* Alert the neaby volunteer, who most possibly be the best first person to react.
* Raise risk level based alarm.
* Another person sitting far away can also raise alarm on the behalf of the needy.
* Incase of mishabs if happens, Application can provide the identity of the person.
* [Like to have] Raise a SOS/Emergency alarm so application could even work in state if no network available.

Note: all the above feature are yet to be tested for fessibility
